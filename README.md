**Enhancing Flight Navigation Mechanism for Optimal Route Planning and Risk Mitigation**


**GOAL**

Design, develop, and implement a robust software solution for identifying optimal flight paths.
Provide real-time risk assessment and alternative route suggestions.
Integrate real-time health metrics tracking from flight sensor data.


**Features**


1.Real Time Route Planner based on weather and three different popular algorithms and logic which includes Dijkstra's algorthm, Haversine algorithm and waypoint logic created by us
2.Real time weather data from open meteo api
3.Flight Maintenance Dashbaord with notifcations to track information about flights .
4.Real time data from flight sensor which include fuel consumption, Pressure, ETG readings.
5.Information about flight map curent flight and summary of flights over a month.
